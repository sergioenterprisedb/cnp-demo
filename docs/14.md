# Scale up & down

The operator allows you to scale up and down the number of instances in a PostgreSQL cluster. New replicas are started up from the primary server and participate in the cluster's HA infrastructure. The CRD declares a "scale" subresource that allows you to use the kubectl scale command.

# Command

```
kubectl scale cluster cluster-example --replicas=4
```
